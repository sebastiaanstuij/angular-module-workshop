# AngularModuleWorkshop
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.

This workshop is meant to make you more familiar with Angular Modules and best practices. 
For more info see the PDF slides in this repo.

This workshop consists of the following exercises:
1: get the app to run (fix 5 module/DI related problems)
2: add a detail view component/module
3: optimize the app:
    a: make the app 'tree-shakeable'
    b: make the detail view 'lazy-loadable'

*for each part you can check out a separate branch with a corresponding starting point, or you can continue with your own branch.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
